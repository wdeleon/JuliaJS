# JuliaJS
Multi-threaded Julia set generator for web browsers

To run: Download all files into the same directory, and open index.html in a web browser.

Tested in Firefox 89.
Other browsers are not necessarily guaranteed to work, but probably should assuming they're reasonably up to date.

Or, just try the live version: https://juliajs.neocities.org/
